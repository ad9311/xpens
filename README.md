## Built With

- ![](<https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-rgb(10%2C%2032%2C%2039)?style=plastic&logo=postgresql>)

### Prerequisites

This web app uses ruby 3.0.1. Make sure you are using the correct version. `rvm use 3.0.1`</br>
Then check ruby version `ruby --version`</br>
PostgreSQL should be installed before using this. Make sure that it is install by entering the following command on the terminal `postgres --version`</br>
If no version provided you will need to install it. [Get PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Getting Started

To get started first clone this project by using the following command `git clone https://github.com/ad9311/xpens.git`</br>
Then change directory into the project's directory `cd xpens`</br>
Before starting the application you will need to run a few commands:</br>

```
bundle install
```

After this, it is required to create a new database and then set it up:

```
rails db:create
rails db:setup
```
**Note:** This app uses a seed (seeds.rb) file so it is important to run `rails db:setup` instead of `rails db:migate`</br>
Failing to do so will have thi app to not work properly.</br>

After this the database should correctly set up.

Now access the project with `rails s` to launch the server and then follow the link http://127.0.0.1:3000 to open it in the browser.</br>

Since no user is registered when launching the app for the first time, you must click sign up and create a new account.</br>
Once done this the user's home page will be presented with four links.</br>

<img src="./docs/images/home_page.png" alt="user_home" width="200"/>
<img src="./docs/images/expenses.png" alt="expenses" width="200"/>
<img src="./docs/images/folders.png" alt="folders" width="200"/>

My Expenses shows all expenses that are part of at least one folder.</br>
My External Expenses shows all expenses that are not part of any folder.</br>
And finally My Folders show all the folders created by the currently logged-in user. Opening a folder will show you all of its expenses.</br>

Expenses can be assigned to multiple folers.
